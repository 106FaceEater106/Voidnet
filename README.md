# Voidnet
Simple decentralized network

## Project goals / minimal specs
* Decentralized node based networks
* Connection to the network can be made via any node
* Nodes are always connected to 3 other nodes minimum
* Each node should have about equal amount of connections
* Capability to "self heal" of a node goes down
* Every node should be aware of the current network topology
* Broadcasting that propagates accross the whole network
* Vector clock based messaging (messages are processed only once)
* Mesages are signed by nodes and sender can be verified
